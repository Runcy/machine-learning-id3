# Candidate Elimination - BITS F464 Assigment 1

## Introduction

One of the most naive processes of finding out the hypothesis given a target concept is the process of Cabdidate elimination which gives the hypothesis which will be a conjunction of the attributes of the instance for which the target concept is to be applied. For this case there are 7 target concepts each dividing animals into a set of 7 classes, and with the one for all approach the general and specific boundaries of the version space are calculated.

## Compilation

In the working directory where the data.txt is present type:
```

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp 
./a.out
``
c++11 is needed to support stoi function used in the code.

## Results
